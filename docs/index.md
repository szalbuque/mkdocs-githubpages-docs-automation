# Introduction

## Problem statement
You want to create a documentation portal which has a good design, but you want to focus only on the content, not on the design itself.
Also, you want this documentation portal to be automaticaly updated whenever you commit something to a GitHub repository.

## Solution
Use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) to generate the documentation portal website. Publish the website using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). Automate the updating with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).
